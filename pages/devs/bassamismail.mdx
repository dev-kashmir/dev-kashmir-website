## Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm a Srinagar based developer and I work at Axelerant as Director of Frontend services. Most of my day is spent managing teams working with JavaScript and Drupal. Early mornings and late night are spent tinkering either cycling, streaming, or working on open source projects.

## What hardware do you use?

I keep switching between macOS and Arch primarily because linux just gives up on me time to time. That said I'd certainly like to switch to Arch full time.

- **Laptops:** Macbook Pro 15 and Dell XPS 13
- **Monitor:** Acer 32" ET322QK C
- **Mouse + Keyboard**: MK850 Performance
- **Smartphone**: iPhone XS

## What software do you use?

- **Editor**: [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/)
- **Terminal**: [st](https://st.suckless.org/)
- **OS**: macOS and Arch

## What programming language would you use if your life depended on it?

TypeScript or Rust

## What is your favourite food to have while programming?

Tea, english breakfast. Hot!

## What is the one piece of advice you would give to a developer getting started?

- Don't get stuck in tutorial hell.
- Follow 40-60 rule, 40% time learning and 60% implementing.
- Maintain a personal blog and share your learning like a journal.

## How can we improve the software development culture in Kashmir?

We should start with more conversations. Gradually move to a local meetup and events.
