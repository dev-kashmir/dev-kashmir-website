## Who are you, and what do you do?

I am a final year Computer Engineering student at NSIT, Delhi and an Incoming SDE at DTDL.

## What hardware do you use?

I mostly use just my macbook for coding. 

## What does your workspace look like?

Very simple, just a single monitor and a desk!


## Image of your workspace

<img
                  className=" image"
                  src={require("../../public/images/workspace/sabeelahmad.jpg")}
                  alt="sabeelahmad workspace"
                />

## What software do you use?

Android Studio for app development and VSCode for all other coding purposes is my go to text editor.

## What programming language would you use if your life depended on it?

Javascript

## What is your favourite food to have while programming?

Cold Coffee with Ice Cream!

## What kind of music do you prefer while working?

EDM

## What is the one piece of advice you would give to a developer getting started?

Don't fall into the pit of taking N number of courses without creating small projects. Always implement whatever you have learnt, even if the ideas are derivative at times.

## How can we improve the software development culture in Kashmir?

I think there needs to be more collaboration between developers. Also it could be fruitful to create a sort of program where all of us together could teach people how to code, conduct workshops.
