## What is the one piece of advice you would give to a developer getting started?

There is always room for improvements and refactoring, start with brute-force. There is always more than 1 way to solve a problem, we all face errors and other difficulties, consistency is the key. Improve your google and stackoverflow skills you dont have to remember everything. Last thing: Stay out from tutorial-hell, stick to official documentations, practice while you learn.

## How can we improve the software development culture in Kashmir?

Personally, I believe software development is underrated in Kashmir, there is no practical examples or stories made out to the people so that people can show  their interest in s/w development. I believe it can be only achieved by public hackathons, public events and showcase proper development stories who has already achieved a lot in this field.
